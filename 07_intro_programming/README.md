####Introduction To Programming
_Time: 75 min_

Many students know programming as a buzz word, and don't realize programming is about solving problems, and then giving  computers steps to solve those problems. This section is meant to clarify what it means to program.


#####Thermostat

| Class Discussion | No solution file |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Time__ | 30 min |
| __Topics__ | pseudo code, conditionals, loops, variables |
| __Description__| Pseudo code for an application that would monitor the room temperature and adjust it so the room remains at a certain temperature. |

#####Rock Paper Scissors

|Exercise | No solution file|
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Time__ | 30 min |
| __Topics__ | pseudo code, programmatic thinking |
| __Description__| Students write pseudo code on their own to program a computer to play the game rock paper scissors. |


####Introduction To JavaScript
__Time: 20 min__

This section is meant to demonstrate the capabilities of Javascript, and get students excited about the next couple of lessons. We often say JS is the behavior of a web site, but students don't actually know what that means. Lets break it down for them.

#####What JS Can Do!

| Class Discussion | No solution file |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Time__ | 15 min|
| __Topics__ | JS, interactivity, server side scripting |
| __Description__| Class discussion about JS capabilities.|

####Reading JS
__Time: 60 min__

We are purposefully omitting jQuery for students introduction to JavaScript. All function names in these stock exercises are meant to be very descriptive. The goal is to have students begin to build their understanding of how code should be read (i.e left to right, top to bottom, and sometimes jumps to functions)

*	We want to teach students how to read code. This is based on the assumption that when you are a child you learn to listen and read before you learn to speak and write. We learned to speak JS with discussion, videos, and pseudo code activities. Now lets teach students how to read. Specifically we want students to understand control flow.

*	We are not focused on syntax, just the flow of the program. This example uses very descriptive function names so that it is easy to follow. You should mention how to link to a JavaScript file.



######Color Switcher
#####Time: 45 min

|Code Along / Walk Through |[Color Switcher Solution File](solution/color_scheme_switcher)|
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Topics__ | html, css, js, functions |
| __Description__| Walk students through the flow of a JS program. |

####Lab Time
__Time: 60 min__

#####Traffic Light

| Exercise |[Traffic Light In Codepen](http://codepen.io/nevan/pen/shtLA) |
| ------------- |:-------------|
| __Time__ | 30 min |
| __Topics__ | reading code, functions, .onclick|
| __Description__| Students read code and make small changes. The goal is to continue to build on the mental model of how JS works with HTML and CSS.|
